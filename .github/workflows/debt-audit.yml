            Analyze technical debt in this project:

            1. Count TD-*.md files in docs/backlog/technical/
            2. Count TODO/FIXME comments in apps/ and src/
            3. Prioritize debt by age and impact
            4. Suggest which should be addressed first

            If debt count >= 10, create a GitHub issue with:
            - Title: "Technical Debt Budget Exceeded"
            - Labels: tech-debt, urgent
            - Body with debt summary and recommendation to run `/debt plan`

            Use gh cli to create the issue if needed.
